# changelog

a command line tool for managing changelogs following the [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com) format.

## why

i like the idea of keeping a changelog but it's a bit of a pain. you need to know what changed, know what version you are on, know how to compare the changes between those, know the [keep a changelog format][kac], manually add the right markdown headers and links for each release.

this tool is aims to make it easy and fun to keep your changelog up to date. it offers commands to review your changes in an interface similar to a git interactive rebase, allowing you to select and reword commit messages into meaningful changelog entries. there's a comand to add `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, and `Security` changes in a structured way. and a command to make a release with easy semver bumping.

### reviewing changes

interactively review git commits and add them to the changelog (similar to `git rebase -i`):

> [ ] abc1234 add user authentication
  [ ] def5678 fix typo in docs

After selecting commits, you'll be dropped into your editor to categorize and reword the changes, just like an interactive rebase.
